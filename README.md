# Qualitative Coding Interface
Web-based UI for assigning qualitative codes to text. Work in progress - play with it [here](https://dwb264.github.io/qualitative-coding/index.html)

Tips for use:
* Single-click a code to show all the text assigned to it
* Double-click a code to edit (backspace all the way to delete it) and hit enter to save changes
* Double-click a piece of text to un-tag it

Built using HTML5 Boilerplate template.
